 * Although it may look like I do most of the work, FreeEMS is already very
 * much a team effort. Right from the start it has been my intention to at the
 * very least attempt to acknowledge and keep track of all those that played a
 * part in the success of the project. What better place to do it than right
 * here in the source code repository!
 *
 * On behalf of all past, present and future users of FreeEMS and spin off
 * projects, I would like to express our sincere gratitude.
 *
