 *
 * @brief Reads Nippon Denso 24/2 sensors
 *
 * This file contains the two interrupt service routines for handling engine
 * position and RPM signals from mainly Toyota engines using this sensor style.
 *
 * One ISR handles the 24 evenly spaced teeth and the other handles the two
 * adjacent teeth. This signal style provides enough information for wasted
 * spark ignition and semi sequential fuel injection.
 *
 * Supported engines include:
 * - 4A-GE
 * - 7A-FE
 * - 3S-GE
 * - 1UZ-FE
 * - Mazda F2T
 *
 * @note Pseudo code that does not compile with zero warnings and errors MUST be commented out.
