Small items:
* Do header hiding to avoid excess globals and make specific includes necessary for various things - remove core/derived vars from visibility inside calc functions, pass pointers as params. remove from general freeems header too. keep more stuff private
* Apply YAGNI principal to code base
* After serial testing is in place by EssEss refactor comms receive to do checksum and length calcs in non-ISR time

Big low priority items:
* create task scheduler - keep main loop time consistent and low
* create hardware abstraction layer - registering port usage etc
* get full testing setup in place:
    * comms protocol itself, low level
    * core comms protocol, shared packets
    * freeems-vanilla packets and behaviour
    * over-comms unit testing of testable functions - could be done with cross compilation also, but that's harder!
    * scheduler testing via autonomous decoder type

Longer term items:
* Write decoders for most platforms
